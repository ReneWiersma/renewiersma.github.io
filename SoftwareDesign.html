	<h2>Software Design - An Approach</h2>
	<p class="date">June 15th, 2022</p>
<p>In this article I will detail an approach to creating a high-level structure for software that works for me. I believe this may be useful for others as well.</p>
<h3>Five high-level responsibilities</h3>
<p>I have found that there are five high-level responsibilities. Every application that does something useful has these responsibilities in some form or shape. They are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Domain</li>
	<li>Infrastructure</li>
	<li>Orchestration</li>
	<li>Construction</li>
	<li>Start-up</li>
</ul>
<h3>Domain</h3>
<p>The responsibility of domain-level code is to express the rules (invariants) and data of the domain. This is also sometimes referred to as the business layer, or logic layer. Domain-level code is expressed in terms that are familiar to those working in the domain.</p>
<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
<p>The responsibility of infrastructure-level code is to send domain-level objects to infrastructure components or retrieve domain-level object from infrastructure components. Infrastructure components interact with the outside world, such as file systems, databases, web services, etc. The user interface is also considered infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Orchestration</h3>
<p>Orchestration-level code is responsible for controlling the flow between the various domain objects, infrastructure components and other orchestration components. This is sometimes also known as the application layer.</p>
<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>Construction-level code contains all the knowledge to build the infrastructure components and orchestration components, and their scope. This may also be known as the composite root.</p>
<p>Note that domain objects are either created in domain-level code itself (in case of new domain objects), or recreated from infrastructure in infrastructure-level code. Therefore, the creation of domain-level objects is not considered construction-level code.</p>
<h3>Start-up</h3>
<p>Start-up level code is responsible for executing the necessary steps to start and run the application. This is also known as program entry.</p>
<p>Complexity arises when these responsibilities are being mixed. Many problems, bugs and other difficulties in code that I have seen over the years can be attributed to code with confusing high-level responsibilities. Therefore, it is a good idea to separate these responsibilities.</p>
