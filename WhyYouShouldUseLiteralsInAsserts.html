	<h2>Why you should use literals in your asserts</h2>
	<p class="date">September 27th, 2020</p>
	<p>I recently came across a unit test that looked similar to this:<p>
<pre class="code">[TestMethod]
public void ValidUserName()
{
	var credentials = new Credentials { Username = "aValidUsername" };
	var sut = new TokenFactory();
	
	var token = sut.CreateToken(credentials);

	Assert.AreEqual(credentials.Username, token.Clientname);
}</pre>
	<p>
	The TokenFactory code creates a token based on the credentials that are passed in. If the username is valid, it should return that same username in a token. This unit test tests that requirement.
	</p>
	<p>On the surface this unit tests looks fine. The code that makes this test pass could look like this:</p>
	<pre class="code">public class TokenFactory
{
	public Token CreateToken(Credentials credentials)
	{
		return new Token { Clientname = credentials.Username };
	}
}</pre>
	<p>The problem here is that we could change the code, breaking the requirement, but still have a passing test. We can do this by introducing a side-effect into the code:</p>
		<pre class="code">public Token CreateToken(Credentials credentials)
{
	credentials.Username = "somethingElse";
	return new Token { Clientname = credentials.Username };
}</pre>
	<p>We can circumvent this problem by asserting on a literal string, instead of on a parameter of the Credentials object:</p>
	<pre class="code">[TestMethod]
public void ValidUserName()
{
	var credentials = new Credentials { Username = "aValidUsername" };
	var sut = new TokenFactory();

	var token = sut.CreateToken(credentials);

	Assert.AreEqual("aValidUsername", token.Clientname);
}
	</pre>
	<p>This way the test will - correctly - fail when the code is broken. I also think using literals makes the test easier to read.</p>
	<p>Of course, the problem of having side effects messing up the code should be prevented altogether by using <a href="Immutability.html">immutable objects</a>, and generally avoiding side-effects. But I think it is a good idea to make your tests as robust as possible.</p>
	<p>To sum it up: use literals in your asserts.<p>
